# DVR, LSR and Flooding algorithms

## Goals
- Use well-established, open protocol standards
- Recognize the underlying different algorithms.

## Features
- [x] DVR Algorithm
- [x] LSR Algorithm
- [x] Flooding Algorithm

## Requirements
The tools used for development and use were:
```sh
Python 3.7+
Slixmpp
numpy
aioconsole
getpass
pandas
tabulate
asyncio
netwrokx
yaml
```

You can install them by running
```sh
pip3.7 install slixmpp aioconsole getpass pandas tabulate numpy asyncio netwrokx yaml
```
